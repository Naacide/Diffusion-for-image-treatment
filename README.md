# Image Diffusion Filters

This repository contains a Python library for image processing using diffusion equations.
It was developed as part of the MA322 course by Nathan AZEDO, David BURGUN, and Laurène REINHART.

The project demonstrates various image filtering techniques based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and numerical integration.

## Features

The library provides several filters for color images:

- **Diffusion filter (`RKimage`)**: Standard diffusion-based smoothing.
- **Gradient-based diffusion (`RKimage_normgrad`)**: Filter using the gradient norm.
- **Laplacian-based diffusion (`RKimage_normlaplace`)**: Filter using the Laplacian norm.
- **Brightness modification (`RKimage_luminosité`)**: Custom brightness adjustment.
- **Random pattern / "Prince de Galles" (`RKimage(fPdeGalles)`)**: Generates a random pattern for artistic effect.
- **Anisotropic diffusion (`fani`)**: Optional function for advanced diffusion (available in the library).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- opencv-python
- tqdm (for progress bars)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tqdm
